To build each project open up the project in the solution explorer and click publish. Then select your desired folder you with to build to and press publish.

For the TicTacToe and Battle Arena games you can find a built version in the folders labeled TicTacToeExe and BattleArenaExe respectively,
if you'd like to build the project yourself the solutions can be found in the folders TicTacToeCPPAssessment and BattleArenaGameCPP respectively.
